Good evening everybody. I am just going to be recording this video. It's going to be a short one minute video and I'm doing this for the purpose of an assignment for a class that I'm doing which specifically focuses on the development and the programming. Really excited to be taking the class. It's been an awesome class so far. So my major is web development. My emphasis is Interaction Design but I really want to get proficient when it comes to development as well and learning certain web languages so that's been great to learn from it as well it's definitely been a little bit of a different concept for me to learn these things but it's been nice none the less. I feel like in this class specifically that I'm taking right now I'm starting to pick up the concepts and kind of understand a little bit better I'm really excited and happy about that. It is currently eleven ten PM on February ninth, It is a Friday night and I'm just looking to get this assignment done.
