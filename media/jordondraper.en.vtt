good evening everybody um I am just

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.640
going to be recording this video it's

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.679
going to be a short uh one minute video

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.240
and I'm doing this for the purpose of an

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.040
assignment for a class that I'm doing uh

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.440
which specifically focus on the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.800
development and the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.560
programming um really excited to be

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.439
taking the class uh it's been an awesome

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.679
class so far um I'm so my major is web

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.560
development um my emphasis is

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.640
interaction design but I really want to

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.280
get efficient when it comes to

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.480
development as well and learning um

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.160
learning uh certain uh web languages so

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.160
it's been great to be able to you know

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.640
learn from it as well um it's definitely

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.640
been a little bit of a different concept

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.199
for me to be able to learn these things

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.280
but uh it's it's been nice uh

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.559
nonetheless I feel like uh in this class

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.719
specifically that I'm taking right now

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.359
I'm starting to pick up uh the concepts

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.160
and kind of understand a little bit

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.879
better so I'm really really excited and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.280
really happy about that uh it is

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:10.200
currently 11:10 p.m. uh February 9th it

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.840
